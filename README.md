# ðŸ’ƒ DanceConnect  

Welcome to **DanceConnect**, your all-in-one platform for dance tutorials, events, and community engagement! This project was created as part of my CodePath Web Development 101 class, where I learned so much throughout the process. I designed the website to connect dancers of all levels, providing a space to learn, share, and celebrate the art of dance. Inspired by my deep love for dancingâ€”particularly Indian fusion danceâ€”it also serves as a celebration of my culture and my passion for movement and expression.
